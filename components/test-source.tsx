        This component is loaded dynamically from a source Typescript file, the
        classic way for dynamic imports in NextJS.

        ðŸŸ¡ Flexibility (This can be loaded whenever we want thanks to
        code-splitting)
        <br />
        ðŸŸ¢ Simplicity (This is the simple, well documented way to load things
        dynamically)
        <br />
